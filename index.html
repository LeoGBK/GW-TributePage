He resigned his command as Commander-in-Chief and retired to civil life. He was an example of the republican ideal of citizen leadership that rejects power. During this period, the office of President of the United States did not exist.</li>

        <p>The first United States Congress voted to pay Washington a salary of $ 25,000 a year, a large sum in 1789. Already wealthy Washington cut the salary, as it valued his image as a disinterested public servant. . At the behest of Congress, however, he eventually accepted the pay, to avoid creating a precedent whereby the presidency would be perceived as an independent position limited only to wealthy individuals who could serve without pay. Washington attended carefully to the pomp and ceremony of office, ensuring that Republican titles and symbols never emulated European royal courts. To that end, he preferred the title "Mr. President" to more majestic suggested treatments.

Washington proved to be a skilled administrator. An excellent delegator of duties and a judge of talent and character, he held regular meetings to discuss cabinet issues before making a final decision. In handling routine tasks, he was "systematic, orderly, energetic, concerned with the opinion of others, but decisive, determined to the general objectives and with coherence in the particular actions with them".

Washington reluctantly served a second term as president. He refused to run for a third party, thus establishing the customary policy of up to two terms for a president, which was later signed into law by the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
